|A professional React application focused on mastering state management techniques, component testing, and modern deployment practices.

🚀 About the Project
This project demonstrates advanced concepts in React, including global state management, reliable component testing, API mocking, and efficient deployment strategies.

It leverages a robust toolset to create scalable, maintainable, and production-ready applications.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React – Frontend framework

Redux – Global state management

Jest & React Testing Library (RTL) – Unit and integration testing

MSW (Mock Service Worker) – Mocking HTTP requests for reliable tests

CSS & JavaScript – Styling and logic

Redis – Server-side caching to improve API response times

Docker – Containerization

CI/CD with GitLab – Automated testing, building, and deployment

Oracle VM – Deployment infrastructure

📦 Key Features
State Management:
Utilizes Redux for scalable and predictable state control across the application.

Reliable Testing:
Integrated Jest and RTL, achieving over 80% test coverage for components and logic.

Mocked API Requests:
Used MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept HTTP requests during testing, increasing test reliability and reducing flakiness.

Performance Optimization:
Implemented Redis caching, significantly reducing server response times.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:
Automated pipelines in GitLab for:

  Running tests
  
  Building Docker images
  
  Deploying to an Oracle VM |
